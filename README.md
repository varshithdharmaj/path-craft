- Implement rag architecture for generating questions from students notes for preparation from their notes of various file forms.
- Prioritize videos with higher engagement (likes and views) when fetching relevant YouTube content.
- Implement transcription and analytics to provide deeper insights into video content and learning patterns.
- Begin with an AI-generated course roadmap and allow users to select the topics they want to include in their course.
- Restrict the LLM from generating any adult (18+) topics to maintain educational integrity.
- Block YouTube searches related to adult (18+) content, ensuring such course paths are automatically abandoned.
